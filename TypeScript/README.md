# Continuous Integration and Unit Testing

## Part 1 - Setup your environment for CI

### As a attendee I want to install a development toolset so that I can develop efficiently

The following tools are installed and have been executed:

- Git (e.g. Git for Windows)
- Visual Studio Code (or another alternative)
- Node: current LTS 
- npm
- TypeScript >= 4

### As a attendee I want to setup a my repository and project so that I can attend the exercises and commit my changes

- Create a local clone from your repository
- Start the IDE and import the provided project
- Check that the project is built correctly in the your local environment

## Part 2 - Unit Testing

### As a attendee I want to implement enough Unit Tests for the Gilded Rose

- Implement as many Unit Tests as necessary for the class GildedRose
- You should already work on this git branch, otherwise check it out
- Implement your tests in the provided template GildedRoseTest
- Measure the achieved coverage with Jest or another the code coverage tool
- Commit your changes and execute the tests in your Github action.
