# github-actions-demo

DEMO PURPOSE:

For our first DevOps Kata we will have some fun with Github Actions!

Our main goal is to create a simple CI Pipeline and to get to know how to use Github Actions within our repository.

Please create a new branch containing your name in it.
The `main` branch won't be touched ðŸ˜‹
